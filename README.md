# simple-bot
A simple discord bot made just for fun!

### Setting the bot
```
git clone https://github.com/ArijitTheDev/simple-bot
```
After that make a `.env` file like this:
```
TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
DB=YOUR_MONGODB_URI
```
Then use this command: 
```
npm install
```
### Note:
Make sure that this isn't a custom handler based bot.
I have used wokcommands framework to make this bot.
Which means you can't use Discord.js V14 version for now.

### Want to contribute?
If you want you can do, But I don't feel to make it a serious bot.
I was bored so I made it for fun!
